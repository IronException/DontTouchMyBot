# DontTouchMyBot
This /kills your bot ReMinecraft bot if people approach it. Keeping bot security simple stupid!

## How to use
Just grab a release and then put it in your plugins. Bada bingo bada bongo it should generate a whitelsit file, in which you can specify people which the bot won't kill itself upon seeing.

## Limitations
Some servers have implemented a /kill cap, which doesn't allow you to /kill immediately after respawning. This could be circumvented but for now we will leave it as-is.
