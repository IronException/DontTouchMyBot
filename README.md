# DontTouchMyBot
This /kills your bot ReMinecraft bot if people approach it. Keeping bot security simple stupid!

## How to use
Just grab a release and then put it in your plugins. Bada bingo bada bongo it should generate a whitelsit file, in which you can specify people which the bot won't kill itself upon seeing.

## Options
You can decide between:
  - killing -> well this is what the plugin is for on it's root
  - shutting down -> in case you want to clear everything by your own and dont want your bot to get into trouble
  - reconnecting -> if your bot is for example in the end or has valuable stuff on it you might favor reconnecting over suicide and loosing everything.
